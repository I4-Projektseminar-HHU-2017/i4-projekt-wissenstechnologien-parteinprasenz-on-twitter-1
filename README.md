Knowledge Technology and Twitter 1.0

This Project Knowledge Technology and Twitter consists of two programs. It aims to be a simple solution for collecting tweets from Twitter and gain knowledge by analyzing text and metadata.
The first programm "Twitteranalyse" collects Tweets from any topic of interest and safes them into a SQLite database. 
The second program "Datamining" offers various functions to analyze the collected Tweets, using SQLite statements, the matplotlib for some graphics and WordCloud for some TagClouds.

Twitteranalyse

1. Register as a Twitter developer
You need to register as a Twitter developer to get the necessary Access Tokens for the API. This can be done here: http://dev.twitter.com 
The Tokens will be generated after the successful registration. You need to copy and paste them into the Code. 

2. Connect to the correct database
This project contains several example databases that can be used. Paste the correct path into the sqlite3.connect statement. 


3. Feel free to modify the CustomStreamListener
The StreamListener handles the incoming tweets, here you can modify the code in the way you want them to be safed.
This Version safes 11 different values from every tweet:

- Tweet ID
- Time Stamp
- User ID
- Text
- Hashtags
- Links
- Mentions
- Language
- Sentiment
- Answer to Tweet ID (If the tweet is an answer to another tweet, the ID of this "original" tweet will be safed here)
- Answer to User ID (If the tweet is an answer to another tweet or user, the of this user will be safed here)

Any value, except the Sentiment, is extracted direct from the tweets metadata. The sentiment is generated by the Textblob library.
Feel free to change or add values depending on your needs.

4. Choose your keywords of interest
Either insert one of the given keyword lists into the startstream method or create your own. Take care that the database you're connected to matches your theme.
