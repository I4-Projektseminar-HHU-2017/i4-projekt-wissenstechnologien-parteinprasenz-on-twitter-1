Party Presence on Twitter 1.0

This Program offers the opportunity to recieve an overview of the twitter presence from the 5 biggest german parties. (CDU/CSU, SPD, Die Grünen, FDP, Die Linke, AfD)
The presence is measured by the number of mentions of the parties themselfs or by mentions of their top candidates.
